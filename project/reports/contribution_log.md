# 📘 **Three-Week Team Contribution Log (Nov 3 – Nov 28)**

*Group G7 — Traffic Accident Severity Prediction*

---

## 🗓 **Week 1 (Nov 3 – Nov 10)**

**Focus: Code Implementation & Initial PPT Draft**

### **Jinglin Zhang — Project Lead**

* Planned the project timeline, milestones, and team workflow
* Drafted the initial **Problem & Stakeholders** section
* Designed the high-level structure and logic of the PPT

### **Liqin Fei — Data Lead**

* Conducted exploratory data analysis on the UK Road Safety dataset
* Cleaned and standardized raw data (drop columns, fill missing values, type fixes)
* Delivered the first processed dataset version
* Created visual elements for the PPT Data section

### **Zhiwen Hui — Modeling Lead**

* Implemented three baseline models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
* Built initial framework for extension models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)
* Visualized baseline performance results in notebooks
* Coordinated with Data Lead regarding feature engineering

### **Jianming Miao — Evaluation Lead**

* Designed evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1, AUC, runtime efficiency)
* Built the evaluation script and produced early comparison results
* Drafted the initial PPT content for the **Results & Insights** section

### **Zhiheng Song — Product & Communications Lead**

* Designed the PPT layout, visual style, and color theme
* Created icons, arrows, and structural diagrams for workflow explanation
* Synchronized team content and organized repository structure
* Set up the initial GitHub repository (`data/`, `src/`, `notebooks/`, `reports/`)

## 🗓 **Week 2 (Nov 10 – Nov 17)**

**Focus: Feature Engineering, Model Tuning, PPT Finalization**

### **Jinglin Zhang**

* Refined the **Problem Statement** based on feedback
* Finalized the PPT “Problem & Stakeholders” section

### **Liqin Fei**

* Performed feature engineering, including datetime extraction (day/month/week)
* Selected **Top 15** features using ANOVA F-test
* Generated final train/test splits (5% representative sample)

### **Zhiwen Hui**

* Completed training and optimization of all five models
* Produced experiment results and performance plots
* Selected final visualizations with Evaluation Lead

### **Jianming Miao**

* Completed full evaluation (Accuracy, F1, AUC, inference speed)
* Identified the core insight:
  *Linear models perform nearly as well as ensemble models due to linear separability*
* Produced the efficiency–performance matrix

### **Zhiheng Song**

* Finalized the complete PPT design and layout
* Integrated all team sections into a coherent narrative
* Produced the first draft of the **Key Insight Figure**
* Organized team review meetings and revisions
